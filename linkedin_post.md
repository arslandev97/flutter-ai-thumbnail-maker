# 🚀 Just built my own AI-Powered Thumbnail Maker with Flutter! 🎨

Excited to share my latest project: **AI Thumbnail Maker**.
I wanted to solve the problem of creating viral YouTube thumbnails quickly, so I built an app that does it for you instantly using the power of Generative AI!

**💡 How it works:**
Simply type a short idea, and the app uses the **Gemini API** to automatically enhance your prompt into a detailed, creative description. Then, **Google's Vertex AI (Imagen 2)** brings it to life as a stunning, high-quality image.

**✨ Key Features:**

- **🤖 AI Magic:** Text-to-Image generation with state-of-the-art models.
- **🧠 Smart Prompts:** Automatic prompt enhancement using Gemini.
- **🔐 Secure & Smart:** Biometric Login (Fingerprint/Face ID) & Firebase Auth.
- **🎨 Sleek UI:** Modern Dark Mode with custom gradients and smooth animations.
- **📱 Cross-Platform:** Built with Flutter for a seamless experience on iOS and Android.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**

- Flutter & Dart
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore)
- Google Vertex AI (Imagen 2)
- Google Gemini API
- Provider (State Management)
